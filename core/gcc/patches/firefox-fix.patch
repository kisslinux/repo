Subject: [PATCH] c++: "perfect" implicitly deleted move [PR100644]

Here we were ignoring the template constructor because the implicit move
constructor had all perfect conversions.  But CWG1402 says that an
implicitly deleted move constructor is ignored by overload resolution; we
implement that instead by preferring any other candidate in joust, to get
better diagnostics, but that means we need to handle that case here as well.

gcc/cp/ChangeLog:

	PR c++/100644
	* call.c (perfect_candidate_p): An implicitly deleted move
	is not perfect.

gcc/testsuite/ChangeLog:

	* g++.dg/cpp0x/implicit-delete1.C: New test.
